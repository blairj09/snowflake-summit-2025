Hello! I'm here to assist you with analyzing the [Snowflake Air Quality](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSTZL7M0KK/snowflake-virtual-hands-on-labs-air-quality-data-united-states?lang=j) dataset. Here are some examples of what you can ask me to do:

- **Filtering and Sorting:**
  - Show only states on the West Coast.

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Which state has the highest average Suspended particulate count?
  - Which state has the highest number of unique observation sites?

- **General Statistics:**
  - Calculate the average Suspended particulate levels for each year.
